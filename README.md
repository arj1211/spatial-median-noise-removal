- [ ] Folders for reconstructed images (matrix), grouped based on distortion level and filter
- [ ] Reconstructed images visualize into image files as examples placed in a folder.
- [ ] Functions for each of the filter
- [x] Function for RMSE calculation
- [ ] Functions for statistical analysis and visualization of RMSE (could be very case by case)
- [ ] Three major graphs in that paper: which mask size is good, which T level is good, and finally which filter is good
